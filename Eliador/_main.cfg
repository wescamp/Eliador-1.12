# CHANGELOG:
# raised from its grave cause I needed some of the puzzle scenarios
# but decided to publish to BfW 1.10 and later anyway
# run wmltools, updaded & rationalized code
# tweaked gold, carryover, unit levels, ...
# changed douzens of fake units to unit variations
# created base images for kids
# localized 'Eliador' on Irdya
# added story
# added translations of german and portuguese

# ISSUES:
# minors left
# dialogue is childdish
# timeline is vague (I assume during Konrad II reign, shortly after EI)
#	# it would be at least tipically for humans to invade other lands after being (tried) to be invaded themselfs...
# the ai in Balas doesnt realy act as promised
# the Reversi game may be gamebeaking for who doesnt know it (and realy easy for those that know)

# STATUS:
# Bugfree & Playable

# For Ideas, Bugreports, Balancing, or any else, simply mail to the maintainer
